                                ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                and deleted when the pod is removed.

                                Use this if:
                                a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                   tracking are needed,
                                c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                   a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                   information on the connection between this volume type
                                   and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                                Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                of an individual pod.

                                Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                more information.

                                A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                persistent volumes at the same time.
                              properties:

                                    Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                    The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                    owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                    pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                    `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                    entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                    is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                    An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                    will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                    volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                    the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                    meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                    owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                    this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                    manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                            dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                            volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                            core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                            When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                            the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                            provisioner.
                                            This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                            if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                            compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                            both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                            value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                            When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                            dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                            There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                            * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                              allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                            * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                              preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                              specified.
                                            * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                              in any namespaces.

                                            (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                            If specified, the CSI driver will create or update the volume with the attributes defined
                                            in the corresponding VolumeAttributesClass. This has a different purpose than storageClassName,
                                            it can be changed after the claim is created. An empty string value means that no VolumeAttributesClass
                                            will be applied to the claim but it's not allowed to reset this field to empty string once it is set.
                                            If unspecified and the PersistentVolumeClaim is unbound, the default VolumeAttributesClass
                                            will be set by the persistentvolume controller if it exists.
                                            If the resource referred to by volumeAttributesClass does not exist, this PersistentVolumeClaim will be
                                            set to a Pending state, as reflected by the modifyVolumeStatus field, until such as a resource
                                            exists.

                            image:

                                image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
                                The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                                - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                                - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                                The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                                A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                                The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                                The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                                The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                                Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath).
                                The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                                    Policy for pulling OCI objects. Possible values are:
                                    Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                                    Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                    IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.
                                    Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise.

                                    Behaves in the same way as pod.spec.containers[*].image.
                                    Pull secrets will be assembled in the same way as for the container image by looking up node credentials, SA image pull secrets, and pod spec image pull secrets.

                              description: |-
                                ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                and deleted when the pod is removed.

                                Use this if:
                                a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                   tracking are needed,
                                c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                   a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                   information on the connection between this volume type
                                   and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                                Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                of an individual pod.

                                Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                more information.

                                A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                persistent volumes at the same time.
                              properties:

                                    Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                    The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                    owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                    pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                    `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                    entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                    is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                    An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                    will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                    volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                    the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                    meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                    owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                    this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                    manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                            volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non

                                            When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of

                                            This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                            if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                            compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                            both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                            value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                            When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                            dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                            There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                            * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                              allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                            * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                              preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                              specified.
                                            * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                              in any namespaces.
                                            (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                            (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
                                The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                                - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                                - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                                The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                                A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                                The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                                The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                                The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                                Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath).
                                The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                                    IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                                          Kubelet performs aggressive normalization of the PEM contents written

                                          The ordering of certificates within the file is arbitrary, and Kubelet

                                ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                and deleted when the pod is removed.

                                Use this if:
                                a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                   tracking are needed,
                                c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                   a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                   information on the connection between this volume type
                                   and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                                Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                of an individual pod.

                                Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                more information.

                                A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                persistent volumes at the same time.
                              properties:

                                    Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                    The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                    owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                    pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                    `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                    entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                    is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                    An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                    will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                    volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                    the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                    meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                    owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                    this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                    manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                            core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                            When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                            the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                            provisioner.
                                            This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                            if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                            compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                            both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                            value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                            When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                            dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                            There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                            * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                              allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                            * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                              preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                              specified.
                                            * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                              in any namespaces.
                                            (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                            (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
                                The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                                - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                                - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                                The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                                A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                                The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                                The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                                The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                                Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath).
                                The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                                    Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                    IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.
                                    Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise.

                                    Pull secrets will be assembled in the same way as for the container image by looking up node credentials, SA image pull secrets, and pod spec image pull secrets.

                      description: |-
                        RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                        This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                        For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                        the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                        Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                        this init container will be continually restarted on
                        exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                        containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                        will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                        is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                        container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                        for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                        container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                        init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                        completed.

                              ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                              The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                              and deleted when the pod is removed.

                              Use this if:
                              a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                              b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                 tracking are needed,
                              c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                              d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                 a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                 information on the connection between this volume type
                                 and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                              Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                              APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                              of an individual pod.

                              Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                              be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                              more information.

                              A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                              persistent volumes at the same time.

                                  Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                  The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                  owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                  pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                  `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                  entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                  is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                  An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                  will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                  volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                  the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                  meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                  owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                  this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                  manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                          dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                          volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                          core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                          When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                          the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                          provisioner.
                                          This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                          if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                          compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                          both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                          value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                          When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                          dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                          There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                          * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                            allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                          * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                            preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                            specified.
                                          * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                            in any namespaces.
                                          (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                          (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                              image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
                              The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                              - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                              - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                              - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                              The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                              A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                              The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                              The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                              The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                              Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath).
                              The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                                  Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                  IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.
                                  Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise.

                                  Behaves in the same way as pod.spec.containers[*].image.
                                  Pull secrets will be assembled in the same way as for the container image by looking up node credentials, SA image pull secrets, and pod spec image pull secrets.

                                    When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of

                                    compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,

                                    value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.

                                    dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                    There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                    * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                      allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                      preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                      specified.
                                    * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                      in any namespaces.
                                    (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                    (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                    ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                    The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                    and deleted when the pod is removed.

                                    Use this if:
                                    a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                    b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                       tracking are needed,
                                    c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                    d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                       a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                       information on the connection between this volume type
                                       and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                                    Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                    APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                    of an individual pod.

                                    Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                    be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                    more information.

                                    A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                    persistent volumes at the same time.
                                  properties:

                                        Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                        The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                        owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                        pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                        `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                        entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                        is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                        An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                        will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                        volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                        the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                        meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                        owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                        this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                        manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                                When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                                There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                                * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                                  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                                * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                                  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                                  specified.
                                                * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                                  in any namespaces.

                                    image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
                                    The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                                    - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                                    - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                    - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                                    The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                                    A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                                    The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                                    The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                                    The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                                    Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath).
                                    The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                                        IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.
                                        Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise.

                              There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                              * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                              * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                specified.
                              * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                in any namespaces.

                                    PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated due to an
                                    API request or management event such as liveness/startup probe failure,
                                    preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                    container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                    PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                    container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                    period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                    or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                        a shell, you need to explicitly call out to that shell.

                                RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                                For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                this init container will be continually restarted on
                                exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                completed.

                                    container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                    PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the

                                    period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                    or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                    The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent
                                    a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal.
                                    Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process.
                                    If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this
                                    value overrides the value provided by the pod spec.
                                    Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via
                                    the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down).
                                    This is a beta field and requires enabling ProbeTerminationGracePeriod feature gate.
                                    Minimum value is 1. spec.terminationGracePeriodSeconds is used if unset.

                                RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                                For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                this init container will be continually restarted on
                                exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                completed.

                                      RecursiveReadOnly specifies whether read-only mounts should be handled
                                      recursively.

                                      If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                      If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
                                      recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made
                                      recursively read-only, if it is supported by the container runtime.  If this
                                      field is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is
                                      supported by the container runtime, otherwise the pod will not be started and
                                      an error will be generated to indicate the reason.

                                      If this field is set to IfPossible or Enabled, MountPropagation must be set to
                                      None (or be unspecified, which defaults to None).

                                      If this field is not specified, it is treated as an equivalent of Disabled.

                                    PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated due to an
                                    API request or management event such as liveness/startup probe failure,
                                    preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                    container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                    PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                    container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                    period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                    or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                                For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                this init container will be continually restarted on
                                exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                completed.

                                        both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                        value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                        When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                        dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                        There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                        * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                          allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                        * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                          preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                          specified.
                                        * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                          in any namespaces.

                                      dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                      volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                      core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                      When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                      the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                      provisioner.
                                      This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                      if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                      compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                      both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                      value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                      When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                      dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                      There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                      * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                        allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                      * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                        preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                        specified.
                                      * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                        in any namespaces.
                                      (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                      (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                      core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                      When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of

                                      value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.

                                      dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                      There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                      * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                        allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                      * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                        preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                        specified.
                                      * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                        in any namespaces.
                                      (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                      (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                    PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the

                                    period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                    or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                                For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                this init container will be continually restarted on
                                exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                completed.

                                      dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                      volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                      core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                      When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                      the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                      provisioner.
                                      This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                      if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                      compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                      both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                      value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                      When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                      dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                      There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                      * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                        allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                      * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                        preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                        specified.
                                      * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                        in any namespaces.
                                      (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                      (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                    preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                    container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                    PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                    container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                    period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                    or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                                For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                this init container will be continually restarted on
                                exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                completed.

                                        dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                        volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                        core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                        When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                        the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                        provisioner.
                                        This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                        if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                        compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                        both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                        value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                        When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                        dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                        There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                        * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                          allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                        * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                          preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                          specified.
                                        * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                          in any namespaces.
                                        (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                        (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                      if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                      compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                      both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                      value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                      When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                      dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                      There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                      * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                        allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                      * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                        preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                        specified.
                                      * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                        in any namespaces.

                                        dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                        volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                        core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                        When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                        the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                        provisioner.
                                        This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                        if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                        compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                        both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                        value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                        When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                        dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                        There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                        * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                          allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                        * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                          preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                          specified.
                                        * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                          in any namespaces.
                                        (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                        (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                        If the resource referred to by volumeAttributesClass does not exist, this PersistentVolumeClaim will be
                                        set to a Pending state, as reflected by the modifyVolumeStatus field, until such as a resource

                                    preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                    container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                    PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the

                                    period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                    or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                                For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                this init container will be continually restarted on
                                exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                completed.

                                      recursively.

                                      If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                      If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
                                      recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made
                                      recursively read-only, if it is supported by the container runtime.  If this
                                      field is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is
                                      supported by the container runtime, otherwise the pod will not be started and
                                      an error will be generated to indicate the reason.

                                      None (or be unspecified, which defaults to None).

                                      If this field is not specified, it is treated as an equivalent of Disabled.

                                RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                                For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                this init container will be continually restarted on
                                exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                completed.

                                        dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                        volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                        core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                        When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                        the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                        provisioner.
                                        This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                        if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                        compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                        both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                        value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                        When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                        dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                        There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                        * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                          allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                        * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                          preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                          specified.
                                        * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                          in any namespaces.
                                        (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                        (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                      dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                      volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                      core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                      When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                      the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                      provisioner.
                                      This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                      if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                      compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                      both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                      value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                      When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                      dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                      There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                      * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                        allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                      * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                        preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                        specified.
                                      * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                        in any namespaces.
                                      (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                      (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                      If specified, the CSI driver will create or update the volume with the attributes defined

                                      it can be changed after the claim is created. An empty string value means that no VolumeAttributesClass
                                      will be applied to the claim but it's not allowed to reset this field to empty string once it is set.

                                      will be set by the persistentvolume controller if it exists.
                                      If the resource referred to by volumeAttributesClass does not exist, this PersistentVolumeClaim will be
                                      set to a Pending state, as reflected by the modifyVolumeStatus field, until such as a resource
                                      exists.

                                        volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                        core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                        When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                        the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                        provisioner.

                                        if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                        compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                        both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                        value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                        When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                        dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                        There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                        * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                          allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                        * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                          preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                          specified.
                                        * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                          in any namespaces.
                                        (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                        (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                      both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                      value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                      When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                      dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                      There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                      * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                        allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                      * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                        preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                        specified.
                                      * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                        in any namespaces.

                      description: |-
                        ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                        The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                        and deleted when the pod is removed.

                        Use this if:
                        a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                        b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                           tracking are needed,
                        c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                        d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                           a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                           information on the connection between this volume type
                           and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                        Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                        APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                        of an individual pod.

                        Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                        be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                        more information.

                        A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                        persistent volumes at the same time.

                        volumeClaimTemplate:

                            Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                            The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                            owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                            pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                            `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                            entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                            is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                            An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                            will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                            volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                            the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                            meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                            owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                            this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                            manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                    compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                    both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                    value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.

                                    dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                    There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                    * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                      allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                      preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                      specified.
                                    * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                      in any namespaces.
                                    (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                    (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                        image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
                        The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                        - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                        - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                        - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                        The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                        A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                        The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                        The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                        The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                        Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath).
                        The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                            IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.
                            Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise.
